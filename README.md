# V-Cuttr
Desktop (Electron) app for basic video editing using *ffmpeg* codec library.

### TODO:

- [ ] Source preview with controls
- [ ] Source details modal (resolution, FPS, aspect ratio, codecs etc.)
- [ ] Capture a particular frame and save as an image (\*.png, \*.jpg)
- [ ] Trim both ends of the video
- [ ] Mute or insert a new audio source
- [ ] Drag'n'drop video file or "Open with..." *V-cuttr* to automatically load as source
- [ ] More advanced video cutting (splitting into scenes, changing their order, cutting them out)
